Legion_v1-0:
	-- Uses swarm algorithm to steer army
	-- very basic fitness function
	-- lacks scouting logic, user must uncover enemy base to attack
	-- army composes of zerglings, then roaches and finally mutas
	-- builds 2 expansion

Legion_v1-2:
	-- expanded economy to build and maintain a fixed ratio of lings,
		roaches, corruptors, mutas, and brood lords
		
		+++ army composition winds up majority lings and roaches with
			few mutas...
		+++  Consider Ravager addition to army
	-- reworked construction order to build spawning pool and troops
		earlier
	-- Added rudimentary scotuing logic where the swarm algo is turned off
		unless enemies are spotted, otherwise wait until 90 troops in
		swarm and head to random enemy spawn... --> problem when there
		are more than one spawn would lead to oscillation in the middle...	
	-- Fitness function still basic...
	*** Won 1 match against all three stock HARD AIs, lost one round to
		Protoss due to constant threat picture leading to troops
		rushing relatively small but competent army with lings one at a time until
		loss... :(
	+++ recommend investigation of multithreading, subswarming, uprgrade
		the fitness function.
