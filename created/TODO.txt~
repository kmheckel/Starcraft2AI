TO DO:

Offense:

-- Roach --> Ravager?

Hydralisks... Need them to augment roaches probably...

-- phase out early units like zerglings?
	-- Algorithm for determining when to produce what unit?
	-- could be a simple unit count -> if army gets destroyed build
	   zergling swarm first



-- Need logic for drones to defend themselves against an early rush
	--> if army under certain size place drones and queen into swarm

-- defense logic not working at all....

-- investigate a strategy/logic of spine crawler/queen garrison force for
early game...
	--> queens provide AA and cast transfusion on the spinecrawlers which
defend the queens at long range on ground...


** swarm algorithm
	+++I GOT A LEGIT PSO TO DRIVE THE MUTAS!!!!!!!!! OH YEAH!!!!
	+ clustering of allies should raise fitness when enemies are spotted -
		have a threshold to prevent unconcentrated attacks
	+ fitness function needs improved.
	+ mutas in range of an enemy, given favorable conditions, should stay
		and fight.. this means the cost should be very low, and the
		logical layer has to match the physical...
	+ generalize algo to all flying units (mutas, corruptors, brood lords)
	+ consider implementing the multiprocessing features if beneficial...
		although current troop counts haven't induced lag,
		parallelization might enable more advanced cost functions

-- upgrade the fitness function for target prioritization
--> 
-- upgrade algorithm to protect higher value units such as mutalisks and brood
lords...
--> kiting during cool down for mutas.




Long term:
	--upgrade swarm algorithm
		? multilayer/sub-swarms
		? some kind of "neural swarm" that uses the mutalisk's
			logical positions to feed a neural net?
	-- integrate machine learning techniques, either NN or GA to tune
		hyperparameters or adjust army composition...


Economy and infrastructure:

implement a more intelligent basis for expansion timing...

-- upgrade research --> in the works..

-- creep spread method **
-- static defense construction and relocation logic --> see garrison idea
-- additional hatcheries?
-- more queens -- > see garrison. garrison queens can also facilitate creep
	coverage
