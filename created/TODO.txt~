TO DO:

Offense:

-- Roach --> Ravager?
-- Zergling to baneling?

-- phase out early units like zerglings?
	-- Algorithm for determining when to produce what unit?
	-- could be a simple unit count -> if army gets destroyed build
	   zergling swarm first
-- upgrade the fitness function for target prioritization
	--> 
-- upgrade algorithm to protect higher value units such as mutalisks and brood
	lords...
	--> kiting during cool down for mutas...
-- place swarm function into separate thread to increase parallelism
-- overlord scouting? <-- short term solution
-- swarm scouting?? <--- ***
	-- figure out how to increase dispersion

Long term:
	--upgrade swarm algorithm
	-- integrate machine learning techniques, either NN or GA


Economy and infrastructure:

-- resolve issue with queens not distributing equally...
-- upgrade research
-- creep spread method
-- static defense construction and relocation logic
-- additional hatcheries?
