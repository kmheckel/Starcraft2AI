TO DO:

Offense:

-- Roach --> Ravager?
-- Zergling to baneling?

-- phase out early units like zerglings?
	-- Algorithm for determining when to produce what unit?
	-- could be a simple unit count -> if army gets destroyed build
	   zergling swarm first
-- upgrade the fitness function for target prioritization
	--> 
-- upgrade algorithm to protect higher value units such as mutalisks and brood
	lords...
	--> kiting during cool down for mutas...

{{{
-- overlord scouting?
	++ make overlords distrivute themselves over expansions and place one at map
center?

-- swarm scouting?? <--- ***
	-- use multiswarm architecture and use cooperation between overlord
		swarm and mutas?
}}}

-- Need logic for drones to defend themselves against an early rush
	--> if army under certain size place drones and queen into swarm


** swarm algorithm
	+++I GOT A LEGIT PSO TO DRIVE THE MUTAS!!!!!!!!! OH YEAH!!!!
	+ clustering of allies should raise fitness when enemies are spotted -
		have a threshold to prevent unconcentrated attacks
	+ fitness function needs improved.
	+ mutas in range of an enemy, given favorable conditions, should stay
		and fight.. this means the cost should be very low, and the
		logical layer has to match the physical...
	+ generalize algo to all flying units (mutas, corruptors, brood lords)
	+ consider implementing the multiprocessing features if beneficial...
		although current troop counts haven't induced lag,
		parallelization might enable more advanced cost functions


Long term:
	--upgrade swarm algorithm
	-- integrate machine learning techniques, either NN or GA


Economy and infrastructure:

-- Dynamic army composition???
-- resolve issue with queens not distributing equally... --> low priority..
-- upgrade research
-- creep spread method
-- static defense construction and relocation logic
-- additional hatcheries?
-- more queens
